## Project boundary

This repository is the **new FlareStarter PPTMaster product**. It is intentionally separate from the original PPTMaster repository:

- **This project** (`flarestarter-pptmaster-shell`) owns the SaaS shell: authentication, users, projects, source upload, confirmations, workflow controls, ownership, and browser downloads.
- **Original PPTMaster** (`ppt-master-productized`) remains the original engine and is maintained separately. It owns the native presentation pipeline, skills, Strategist/Executor implementation, SVG/PPTX generation, and its original SaaS control plane.
- This project calls PPTMaster through a server-side API boundary. PPTMaster URLs and internal credentials must never be exposed to the browser.

The original PPTMaster `main` is not vendored into this repository and is not modified by this project's development workflow.

FlareStarter ships only what actually works: every feature in this repo is a real implementation — no mocks, no stubs, no placeholder TODOs padding the count. It all runs on the Cloudflare free-to-cheap stack (Workers + D1 + KV).

## Core advantages

- **Edge-native compute**: Cloudflare Workers — millisecond responses worldwide, no cold starts.
- **Near-zero ops cost**: built around CF's free tiers; start at $0 and absorb traffic spikes effortlessly.
- **Batteries included**: no library archaeology — auth, billing, email and the other SaaS essentials work out of the box.
- **End-to-end type safety**: one TypeScript chain from the database (Drizzle) to the frontend (TanStack Start).

## Preview

Dark-first design with a terminal aesthetic. Every shot below is a real running screen — the admin console runs on real data, no fabricated metrics. Try it live on the [demo](https://flarestarter.com).

**Admin console · stats dashboard** (registrations / active / subscriptions, all real)

## What's inside

| Area | What you get |
|------|--------------|
| **Auth** | Email/password with mandatory verification, password reset, and account deletion via [better-auth](https://better-auth.com). Google & GitHub OAuth that gracefully hide themselves when their env vars are unset. Sessions use D1 as source of truth with a cookie cache. |
| **Billing** | [Stripe](https://stripe.com) subscriptions (monthly/yearly) **and** one-time lifetime purchase, a Customer Portal link, plan-gated routes (`requirePlan`), idempotent webhook handling, and best-effort billing event hooks (e.g. "send an email when Pro activates"). Failed renewals surface an in-app "update your payment method" banner (retry emails are left to Stripe) — see [billing](https://flarestarter.com/docs/features/billing). |
| **Storage** | [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) object storage with a working avatar upload (validated, streamed back through a serving route since R2 isn't public). Zero-config locally via miniflare. The reference for any file-upload feature — see [storage](https://flarestarter.com/docs/features/storage). |
| **Email** | [Resend](https://resend.com) with string templates (React Email isn't usable on workerd). Missing API key? Emails are captured to the console so local dev never blocks. |
| **Waitlist** | A complete pre-launch signup loop: a public signup page, Turnstile bot protection, an admin management page + CSV export, and automatic subscriber sync into a [Resend](https://resend.com) audience (gracefully skipped when unconfigured). |
| **Changelog** | An in-app `/changelog` page — MDX-driven, per-locale, with a `published` flag — turning release notes into a real product page rather than just a `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo. |
| **Sponsor** | A standalone `/sponsor` page demoing a real Stripe donation loop: **pure donation — unlocks nothing** (entitlement untouched). Both one-time and monthly are **amount-driven** (PWYW/custom amount, inline `price_data.recurring` — no pre-created Price IDs needed). One-time sponsorships also accept **WeChat Pay** (via Stripe's `wechat_pay` — no WeChat merchant account needed; presentment currency and a fixed FX rate live in config, and the USD equivalent is frozen at checkout — see the [billing docs](https://flarestarter.com/docs/features/billing)). GitHub thank-you **avatar wall grouped by amount tier**, with optional public message. Monthly subscriptions are cancellable via the Stripe portal. Webhook dispatched by metadata + idempotent recording. Degrades to a "not configured" state without a Stripe key. Customize via `src/features/sponsor/sponsor.config.ts` (amounts/tiers/toggles/thresholds) + i18n `sponsor.*` copy — no component edits needed. |
| **Feedback** | Signed-in users submit feedback + a "my feedback" list (delete your own `open` items); an admin governance page drives status transitions (open/planned/shipped/closed) and one-line replies; admin-submitted items show a Pro badge (demoing `hasProAccess`). Also the **reference for adding your own feature**: a vertical slice exercising ownership filtering (`db/scope`), a pure function layer, both gate patterns, and dual-pool tests — see [feedback](https://flarestarter.com/docs/features/feedback). |
| **i18n** | Path-based locale routing via TanStack's `{-$locale}` optional prefix — English at `/`, 中文 at `/zh`. Marketing copy and UI strings both translated. |
| **SEO** | Per-locale sitemap, `hreflang`, canonical URLs, OpenGraph tags, `robots.txt`, and `noindex` on authenticated pages. |
| **AI-ready** | **Runtime:** built-in [`llms.txt`](https://flarestarter.com/llms.txt) index and [`llms-full.txt`](https://flarestarter.com/llms-full.txt) full corpus, clean frontmatter-stripped Markdown for any doc page via `/docs-md/*`, and a `robots.txt` pointing to both — so AI crawlers and answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, …) can index and cite your content. **Codebase:** [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (auto-imported into [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)) is a single source of truth that lets coding agents like Claude Code / Codex understand this repo and build on it right away. |
| **Admin** | better-auth admin plugin: roles, ban, user impersonation, a searchable/paginated user table, and a stats dashboard (registrations / active / subscriptions) — all built on real data, no fabricated metrics. |
| **Theme** | Dark-first design with a light/dark toggle persisted via cookie. |
| **Security & observability** | Turnstile bot protection, security headers + production CSP, auth-endpoint rate limiting (D1-backed), startup env validation (fail-fast); CF Web Analytics (cookieless) and Sentry error reporting — all optional, off when their keys are blank. See [security](https://flarestarter.com/docs/platform/security) / [observability](https://flarestarter.com/docs/platform/observability). |
| **Dev/Ops** | A Cron Triggers reference implementation (daily cleanup of expired sessions/tokens/rate-limit rows), local/staging/prod environment separation, and GitHub Actions CI (lint + typecheck + build). |

## Tech stack

- **[TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start)** (React 19, file-based routing, server functions)
- **[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)** runtime, deployed via the `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`
- **[D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)** (SQLite) with **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)** + migrations
- **[KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/)** for caching, **[R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)** for object storage — wired end-to-end (validated upload + private serving route), with avatar upload as the reference
- **[better-auth](https://better-auth.com)**, **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)**, **[Resend](https://resend.com)**
- **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com)**
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev)** (Node unit tests + Workers/D1 integration tests via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22 (recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [volta](https://volta.sh/))
- **pnpm** >= 9
- A **Cloudflare** account (free tier is enough to start)
- `wrangler` CLI (already installed as a dev dependency, no need to install globally)

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install
pnpm install

# 2. Create your local Wrangler config (holds D1/KV ids etc.; git-ignored,
#    the reference template is committed)
cp wrangler.example.jsonc wrangler.jsonc

# 3. Configure local env (copy the example and fill in what you need)
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
#    Everything is optional locally — blank Stripe/Resend keys degrade
#    gracefully (no billing, console-captured emails).

# 4. Create the local D1 schema
pnpm db:migrate:local

# 5. Run it
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

### Useful scripts

```bash
pnpm dev               # dev server on :3000
pnpm build             # production build
pnpm test              # full test suite (Vitest)
pnpm typecheck         # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint              # eslint
pnpm db:generate       # generate a Drizzle migration from schema changes
pnpm db:migrate:local  # apply migrations to local D1
pnpm db:reset:local    # wipe + re-migrate + re-seed local D1
pnpm cf-typegen        # regenerate worker-configuration.d.ts from wrangler.jsonc
```

## Environment variables

See [`.dev.vars.example`](.dev.vars.example) for the full list. Locally everything is optional and degrades gracefully. For production, the required secrets and how to set them are documented in [deploy](https://flarestarter.com/docs/getting-started/deploy):

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (also drives canonical/sitemap origin) — **required**; validated at startup ([security](https://flarestarter.com/docs/platform/security))
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` (email; blank → console-captured)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` (optional social login)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_*` (billing); `STRIPE_WECHAT_PAY_ENABLED` (optional — set `false` to turn off WeChat Pay on the sponsor page)
- `ADMIN_EMAILS`
- `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (optional bot protection — [security](https://flarestarter.com/docs/platform/security))
- `CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_DSN` (optional analytics + error reporting — [observability](https://flarestarter.com/docs/platform/observability))

Every optional integration degrades gracefully: leave its keys blank and the
feature simply turns off. The startup env validator catches misconfigurations
(missing required vars, half-configured OAuth/Turnstile pairs) and fails fast.

## Deployment

Once resources and secrets are set, shipping is two steps:

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production pnpm build   # environment is chosen at build time (see below)
wrangler deploy
```

> Cloudflare environment is selected **at build time** via `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` (not `wrangler deploy --env`), because the Vite plugin bakes the chosen bindings into the build.

The **full first-time walkthrough** — creating D1/KV, setting secrets, running remote migrations, configuring the Stripe webhook — is in **[deploy](https://flarestarter.com/docs/getting-started/deploy)**.

> R2 (object storage) is enabled by default in `wrangler.jsonc` and wired into the code (avatar upload reference). Before deploying, create the bucket: `wrangler r2 bucket create flarestarter-files` (see [storage](https://flarestarter.com/docs/features/storage)).
